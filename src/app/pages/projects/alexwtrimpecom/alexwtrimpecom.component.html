                In making this website, I never intended for it to be what it
                became, but it did turn out to be a pretty fun project that I
                really enjoyed and learned a lot from. I started making it
                because I had stupidly purchased a Raspberry Pi solely for the
                fact that I thought they were really cool seeing all of the
                projects people had done and how cheaply they can be purchased.
                So I found a really good deal on a set that came with the Pi, a
                case, an SD card, and the cord and then I made a late night
                purchase, because all great purchases that I make always seem to
                come right before the AM. It arrived really fast which is great
                except when the whole purchase was not a great buy anyway. I sat
                on it for a few months since I was about to graduate college,
                and then I got the idea to use it as a web server. I previously
                had a website but I was not fond of the idea of paying each
                month just to have a site to play around with, and this would be
                a really inexpensive way to go about hosting a site that I could
                have fun with and also learn a bit. The steps below are the
                steps I took in creating my site so you can copy it as well. I'm
                not going to lie, this was a lot more work than I thought it
                would be when I first started out. It would have been so much
                simpler, and admittedly better if I had just paid for a hosting
                service, but I learned so much in going this project and I
                continue to learn from it as I am constantly updating this site
                and trying new things. I would recommend it to anyone who is
                looking to learn something about hosting as well as just enjoy a
                project for yourself.

              As mentioned, this all began from a Raspberry Pi, which you will
              also need if you want to replicate what I have done. Actually, you
              could use any other computer but the names of any of those
              machines are not nearly as cool as Raspberry Pi. If you do have a
              Raspberry Pi, it comes with an easy way to install an operating
              system. I chose Debian Stretch (9), and followed the instructions
              for that setup. I used Nginx as my server, but you can use Apache
              as well. This will lead you through my steps and hopefully this
              article will help you as well. While I doubt this is actually up
              to any internet providerâ€™s terms of service, it is an innocent way
              to learn about a new tool. That being said, I am very strongly
              opposed to running any sort of business from this and it is not a
              good way to go about it anyway. Use a service that can provide
              better resources and greater reliability. If you are intending to
              just use this for a hobby site, I can absolutely get behind that
              and I will help you with achieving that dream. To start, I would
              recommend you plug in your Pi directly into an Ethernet port on
              the back of your router to ensure a constant connection. This may
              be slightly inconvenient, but it is much better in the long run.
              Next, you will need to either open up terminal on your Pi or SSH
              into it. You probably cannot SSH immediately but I would suggest
              this as it can be burdensome to log into your PI each time you
              want to update your site or change configurations of any kind. In
              the end of this article I will show you how to enable SSH. First,
              run the commands below after setting up your Pi in install your
              Nginx server.
            </p>
            <div class="codeBlock">
              <ngx-highlight-js lang="bash" code="sudo apt-get update">
              </ngx-highlight-js>
              <ngx-highlight-js lang="bash" code="sudo apt-get install nginx">
              </ngx-highlight-js>
            </div>

            <p class="entry-content">
              At this point, Nginx should be listed as an available service on
              your Raspberry Pi so you can run the following command to get the
              service to start it and view the default nginx webpage:
            </p>

            <div class="codeBlock">
              <ngx-highlight-js lang="bash" code="sudo service nginx start">
              </ngx-highlight-js>
            </div>

            <p class="entry-content">
              After the service is running, Nginx should be serving a default
              page from the /var/www/html folder within your Pi. To view this
              default page, go to to IP address of the Pi. If you are unsure of
              the IP address the Pi has been assigned, log into your router and
              find the connected devices to your router. Most likely one is
              listed as Raspberry Pi and will a local IP such as:
              <code>http://192.168.1.2</code>. I wish I could give you more
              specific instructions about this, but every router is different
              and I do not what to lead you in the wrong direction. It is at
              this time that I would suggest you configure your router to always
              give the same IP address to your Pi. This will help in the next
              step and prevent you from having to reconfigure each time your
              router restarts.
            </p>

            <p class="entry-content">
              It is next that you will want to open up a port on your router in
              order to forward public requests to your router's public IP,
              onward to your Raspberry Pi. If you intend to just host a regular
              website wtih no security certificates, just use port 80. If you
              want to use SSL (HTTPS) on your website, you will also need to
              open port 443. Foward both of these ports to the Pi. You can find
              these settings within the routing configuration rules on your
              personal router. Later, I explain that I use an API built in
              Python and Flask which I have running on an additional port. You
              will want to forward this port to your Pi as well if you want to
              make your website work with the same functionality I have. (By
              this port I mean whichever port you decide to run your API from.
              You can choose any but I normally do 5000).</p>

            <h4 class="entry-content">Enable SSH</h4>
            <p class="entry-content">
              In order to update your website, you will want to have SSH enabled
              on your device. This will allow you to make changes to your
              website and update the files without having to transfer your files
              to a flash drive and then move manually to the Pi. This way, you
              can use an FTP client like WinSCP to transfer files to and from.
              In order to enable SSH, do the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol class="entry-content">
              <li>Run :<code>sudo raspi-config</code></li>
              <li>Go to Advanced Options and SSH</li>
              <li>Select enable</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="entry-content">That is all! You can now go off on your own
              project.</p>

            <h4 class="entry-content">Making the Website</h4>
            <p class="entry-content">
              The reality is that you can use whatever you would like to make
              your own website. You can choose to right raw HTML or you can use
              a framework to build this out for you. No matter what it is, I
              challenge you to push yourself to learn something new. Make it in
              something you have never done before and make it in something you
              can get excited about learning. If you are using Nginx from the
              previous steps, I would avoid using anything with PHP though. It
              just does not work the best and may be a headache. In any regard,
              I used Angular and I encourage you to give Angular a go as well.
              It is a fairly well built package and can really help you get your
              app/project up and running in a sort time. To start, I would
              suggest checking out <a href="https://angular.io/"> Angular's
                website</a> for their suggestions on getting started. I wish I
              could provide some better guidance on getting your site up and
              running but every site is so unique that I may not be steering you
              in the right direction. Best of luck though and feel free to reach
              out if you have any questions!
            </p>

            <h4 class="entry-content">Creating the API</h4>
            <p class="entry-content">
              Since Nginx and PHP do not play nice, I had to create an API which
              handles all of my messaging communications and other features of
              the website. It is actually a really nice way to solve the problem
              , and in my opinion a better way to go about learning. It has the
              added benefit of allowing for better future expansion
              capabilities, but this route will require you to learn complete a
              few more steps. To start, you will need to install the packages
              below in order to copy what I have done. I am not going to give
              out my source code because it is not the prettiest, but these are
              very common technologies and I am sure you will be able find help
              on anything you need. As always, I am more than happy to answer
              any questions you may have as well.
