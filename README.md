This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

Is this project overkill for a personal website? Absolutely it is. I have made
this site as a way to explore and learn more about Angular while running this site
and its related API on my Raspberry Pi. Feel free to use this or any components
within as a building block for your own learning.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
